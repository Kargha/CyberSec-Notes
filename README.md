# OSCP-Notes

This is just my collection of things from various sources that I used while studying for the OSCP. This will be updated over time with new tips and tools as I come across them.

Please note that they were written for my own use originally, so many of them are still very short form and don't have too much explanation. I hope to improve this over time, but this is currently just a side project for now.

Notes:

- Special thanks to Tib3rius, creator of the ![AutoRecon tool](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon), as well as the Linux (https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprivesc) and Windows (https://tryhackme.com/room/windows10privesc) privilege escalation rooms from which the majority of my privilege escalation material came from. Without his tools and knowledge, I would not have passed the exam. If you enjoy his rooms, please consider buying his courses over at Udemy, the additional video content is definitely worth it.

# OSCP-Notes

This is just my collection of things from various sources that I used while studying for the OSCP. This will be updated over time with new tips and tools as I come across them.

Please note that they were written for my own use originally, so many of them are still very short form and don't have too much explanation. I hope to improve this over time, but this is currently just a side project for now.
